My solutions to advent-of-code

NOTE: I am not proud of most of these, just getting them done. Some days I stick to a suboptimal/convoluted solution because it's easier to code. Other days I choose to do something a harder way because it's fun even though the brute force solution would work fine. Some days I chose to use AI, while other days I did not, even though it probably could have one-shot the solution.
